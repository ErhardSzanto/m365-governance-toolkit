# 12-Month Roadmap (M365 Governance)

This roadmap is a practical Now/Next/Later view aligned to:
- Safe use (veilig gebruik)
- Manageability (beheerbaarheid)
- Adoption/value

## Now (0–3 months) — Stabilise and standardise
**Governance & Operating Model**
- Publish governance charter, RACI, decision rights
- Implement intake/triage workflow and backlog scoring

**Standards & Guidelines**
- Naming convention and provisioning template
- Lifecycle management (ownership + review cadence)
- External sharing / guest access standard (limited-by-default)

**Security & Compliance Baseline**
- Establish label taxonomy (Public/Internal/Confidential/Highly Confidential)
- Publish label policy (pilot group → wider rollout)
- Implement DLP starter policy (pilot → warn mode)

**Adoption**
- Create “safe collaboration” quick guides
- Establish communication templates for changes

## Next (3–6 months) — Improve control and consistency
**Governance**
- Introduce regular service reviews (KPIs, exceptions, adoption)

**Security & Manageability**
- Tighten external sharing rules based on pilot feedback
- Implement periodic access/guest reviews (process + reporting)
- Expand DLP coverage (tune false positives; add high-risk blocks)

**Operational maturity**
- Standard runbooks for incident/change/service requests
- Release calendar and CAB-lite recurring meeting cadence

**Adoption**
- Targeted training for owners (responsibilities, reviews, sharing rules)

## Later (6–12 months) — Optimise and scale
**Automation & Reporting**
- Automate ownership reminders and lifecycle checks where possible
- Define dashboard/reporting for governance KPIs (owners, guests, exceptions, incidents)

**Advanced governance**
- Improve templates and standards based on usage patterns
- Extend governance to additional M365 services/features as required

**Continuous improvement**
- Quarterly roadmap refresh; retire unused features; reduce tool sprawl
