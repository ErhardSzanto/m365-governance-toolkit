# Prioritisation Method (Backlog)

This backlog uses a simple scoring method suitable for functional management:

## Scoring
Each item is scored on:
- **Value (1–5):** impact on users, productivity, service quality
- **Risk Reduction (1–5):** improves safety/compliance/manageability
- **Effort (1–5):** complexity/time/cost

**Priority Score = Value + Risk Reduction − Effort**

## Priority bands
- **P1 (High):** Score 7–9 (deliver in “Now”)
- **P2 (Medium):** Score 4–6 (deliver in “Next”)
- **P3 (Low):** Score 1–3 (deliver in “Later”)

## Governance guardrails
- Security/Compliance constraints override backlog preference (e.g., mandatory controls)
- Exceptions require documented approval and an expiration/review date
