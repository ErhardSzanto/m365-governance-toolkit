# Executive Summary

## Purpose
This repository is a practical governance toolkit for Microsoft 365 (M365).  
It demonstrates how I would help an organization build a **safe, modern, and manageable digital workplace** by defining governance, standards, and an operating model for continuous improvement.

## Scope (in scope)
This toolkit covers governance and “safe use” practices for:
- Microsoft Teams
- SharePoint Online
- OneDrive for Business
- Exchange Online (basic governance and safe-use principles)
- Microsoft Purview (information protection + DLP starter approach)
- Identity & access principles (Microsoft Entra basics)

## Out of scope (non-scope)
This toolkit does **not** cover deep engineering or advanced platform build work such as:
- Custom development, automation engineering, or complex scripting
- Full enterprise architecture design
- Advanced security engineering beyond baseline governance
- Migrating legacy platforms at scale

## Outcomes / Deliverables
This repository provides:
- A Governance Charter (objectives, principles, decision rights, RACI, KPIs)
- A Service Operating Model (intake, triage, backlog, change/release)
- Standards & Guidelines (naming, lifecycle, external sharing, collaboration rules)
- Security & Compliance Baseline (labels + DLP starter policies)
- (Planned) Backlog + 12-month roadmap + runbooks + evidence screenshots from a trial tenant
