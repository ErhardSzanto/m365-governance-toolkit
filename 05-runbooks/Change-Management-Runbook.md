# Change Management Runbook (M365) — CAB-lite

## Purpose
Ensure changes to M365 configuration, governance standards, or policies are safe, communicated, and reversible.

## What counts as a change
- Enabling/disabling features
- Updating external sharing settings
- Publishing or modifying sensitivity label policies
- Deploying/changing DLP policies
- Governance standard updates that affect user behaviour at scale

## Change workflow
### 1) Define the change
- What is changing?
- Why (security, compliance, manageability, functionality)?
- Who is impacted?
- When will it happen?

### 2) Risk assessment
- Security/compliance risk
- Operational risk (support load, user disruption)
- Mitigations (pilot, phased rollout)

### 3) Pilot (recommended)
- Select pilot group
- Define success criteria
- Collect feedback and incident patterns

### 4) Communication plan
- Use the Change Announcement template
- Provide “what users need to do”
- Provide support channel

### 5) Release
- Execute change in planned window
- Monitor for incidents and user impact

### 6) Rollback plan (mandatory)
- What is the rollback trigger?
- How to revert configuration
- Communication if rollback occurs

### 7) Post-change review
- Was the goal achieved?
- Any incidents/feedback?
- Update documentation and backlog items

## Documentation requirement
A change is not complete unless:
- Standards/guidelines updated (if impacted)
- Runbooks updated (if required)
- Backlog item includes acceptance criteria + evidence
