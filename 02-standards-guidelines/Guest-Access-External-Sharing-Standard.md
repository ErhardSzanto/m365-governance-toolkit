# Guest Access & External Sharing Standard

## Default stance
**Limited-by-default**
- External sharing is allowed only for approved business needs
- Guests are invited via an approval workflow and are time-bound

## Approved use cases
- Collaboration with external research partners on a defined project
- Vendor collaboration where contract requires document exchange
- Joint work with partner organizations on patient-care operational workflows (when appropriate)

## Expiration policy
- Guest access expires after **90 days** unless renewed by the Team/Site owner
- External links (if used) must have expiry dates (e.g., 14–30 days)

## Approval workflow
1. Requester submits: purpose + owner + guest email domain + duration + data classification
2. Business Owner approves
3. Security/Compliance approval required for:
   - “Confidential / Highly Confidential” data contexts
   - Broad external sharing or new/untrusted domains
4. M365 team provisions access and records the decision

## Required classification/label
Before sharing externally:
- Content must be classified and labeled (at least **Internal** or higher)
- For Confidential/Highly Confidential:
  - External sharing requires explicit approval and documented risk acceptance

## Rationale
External sharing is a common risk source. Clear controls protect:
- confidentiality and compliance
- operational manageability (guest sprawl)
- auditability of decisions
