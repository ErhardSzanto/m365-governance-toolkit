# Teams & SharePoint Naming Convention

## Policy
All Teams and SharePoint sites must follow the naming format:

**ORG-DEPT-PURPOSE-REGION**  
Example: `UMCG-DD-COLLAB-GRN`

## Rules
- Allowed characters: A–Z, 0–9, hyphen (-)
- No emojis or special characters
- Max length: 40 characters (keep names short and searchable)
- Use consistent department codes (e.g., DD, HR, FIN, IT)
- Avoid personal names unless it is a formally approved personal workspace

## Examples
### Good
- `UMCG-DD-PROJECTX-GRN`
- `UMCG-HR-ONBOARDING-NL`

### Bad (and why)
- `Project X Team!!!` (special characters, unclear ownership)
- `Johns Team` (personal naming, not scalable)
- `DD_Project_2026` (underscore + inconsistent pattern)

## Rationale (why this matters)
- Improves **searchability** and reduces duplicate Teams/Sites
- Supports **manageability** (ownership, lifecycle reviews, reporting)
- Enables consistent **governance** (templates, policies mapped by naming)
