# Collaboration Guidelines (Safe Use)

## When to use what
- **Teams:** day-to-day collaboration, chat, meetings, channels, quick files for teamwork
- **SharePoint site:** structured document storage, versioning, controlled access, long-term team content
- **OneDrive:** personal working area and draft documents; share internally when ready
- **Email/Exchange:** formal communication, external contact when Teams is not appropriate

## Where to store sensitive documents
- Store **Confidential / Highly Confidential** content in:
  - SharePoint with restricted permissions, and
  - Sensitivity labels applied
- Avoid storing sensitive content in uncontrolled places (personal devices, unlabelled shares)

## External guests: do’s and don’ts
### Do
- Use approved workflow for guest invitations
- Set expiration and review guests regularly
- Apply labels and DLP rules for sensitive content

### Don’t
- Add guests to wide “all staff” Teams/Sites
- Share Highly Confidential documents via anonymous links
- Bypass standards “because it’s urgent” (use the exception process instead)

## Example scenarios
- **Project team working internally:** Teams + SharePoint (label: Internal)
- **External partner collaboration:** Dedicated Team/Site with limited membership, time-bound guests, label: Confidential (if required)
