# M365 Governance Toolkit

A practical governance toolkit for Microsoft 365 (M365): intake → prioritised backlog → standards & guidelines → security/compliance baseline → runbooks → roadmap.
Built to demonstrate functional management + product ownership practices for a safe and manageable digital workplace.

## What’s inside
- Governance charter + operating model (RACI, decision rights, intake & prioritisation)
- Standards & guidelines (Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive, naming, lifecycle, external sharing)
- Security & compliance baseline (identity, labels, DLP starter)
- Product backlog + 12-month roadmap
- Runbooks (incident, change, service requests)
- Evidence (screenshots + notes from a trial tenant)
