# Governance Charter (M365)

## Objectives
1. **Veilig gebruik (Safe use):** reduce data leakage and misuse through clear rules, labels, and controlled sharing.
2. **Beheerbaarheid (Manageability):** keep M365 supportable through standardization, lifecycle ownership, and predictable changes.
3. **Adoption & value:** enable effective collaboration (Teams/SharePoint/OneDrive) with guidance, training, and consistent ways of working.

## Principles
- **Least privilege:** grant the minimum access required; review access regularly.
- **Secure-by-default:** default configurations favor safety; exceptions require approval and documentation.
- **Standardize before customize:** use standard templates/policies first; customize only when justified.
- **Lifecycle ownership:** every Team/Site has an owner responsible for membership, content, and reviews.
- **Transparency:** decisions and changes are recorded; users receive clear communication.

## Decision rights
### M365
- Day-to-day standards (naming, lifecycle rules, templates)
- Backlog prioritisation within agreed guardrails
- Operational improvements and adoption materials

### Security / Compliance (InfoSec) decides
- Mandatory security/compliance controls (e.g., classification rules, DLP requirements)
- Risk acceptance rules and exception thresholds
- Audit requirements and reporting expectations

### Business / Product Management decides
- Product vision and strategic priorities (multi-year direction)
- Funding/time allocation and major trade-offs
- Approval of high-impact changes (major policy shifts)

- **Governance compliance:** % Teams/Sites with assigned owners; % reviewed on schedule
- **Policy exceptions:** number of exceptions; time-to-close exceptions; repeat offenders
- **Request fulfilment:** time-to-fulfil common requests (new Team/Site, guest access)
