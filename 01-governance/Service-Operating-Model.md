# Service Operating Model (M365)

## Intake channels
Requests and issues can enter via:
- Service desk ticketing (preferred)
- A standard request form (for new Teams/Sites, guest access, exceptions)
- Email (only for urgent cases; converted into tickets)

## Triage (categorise incoming work)
All incoming items are categorised within 1 business day:
1. **Incident:** something is broken or blocking work (e.g., access failure, service outage)
2. **Service request:** standard request (e.g., new Team/Site, add guest, restore file)
3. **Change:** planned modification to configuration/policy (e.g., enable feature, update setting)
4. **Enhancement:** improvement/new capability (e.g., new template, new governance process)

## Prioritisation method
Each backlog item receives a simple score:
- **Value (1–5):** benefit to users/operations
- **Risk reduction (1–5):** improves safety/compliance
- **Effort (1–5):** complexity/time

Priority Score = Value + Risk − Effort

Work is prioritised weekly with:
- Product Manager (direction/roadmap)
- Security/Compliance (risk constraints)
- Operations (service health)

## Change & release process (CAB-lite)
For changes affecting many users or governance settings:
1. **Define change** (what/why/impact)
2. **Risk assessment** (security + operational risk)
3. **Pilot** (small user group if possible)
4. **Communication** (what changes, when, what users must do)
5. **Release window** (planned timing)
6. **Rollback plan** (how to revert if issues occur)
7. **Post-change review** (issues, adoption, lessons learned)

## Documentation requirement
No governance or configuration change is considered “done” unless:
- Relevant standards/guidelines are updated, and
- Runbooks (incident/service request) are updated where needed, and
- The backlog item includes acceptance criteria and evidence of completion.
